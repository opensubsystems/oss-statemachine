OpenSubsystems is using open-source friendly dual licensing model the guiding
principle of which is one of fair exchange, or Quid pro Quo ("something for 
something"). The basic idea is that if your organization is deriving commercial
benefit from solutions built using OpenSubsystems software and does not release
the complete source code of it's solution, then it is required to obtain 
commercial license from OpenSubsystems.

OpenSubsystems is available under two licenses: OSI approved GNU Affero General 
Public License (AGPL) v3 or later and OpenSubsystems commercial license.

   1. All software, documentation, resources and other materials developed as 
      part of OpenSubsystems project are licensed under AGPL v3 or later. If 
      your application is licensed under AGPL or it is licensed under compatible 
      OSI license approved by OpenSubsystems, you are free and more then welcome 
      to include and distribute OpenSubsystems software with your application. 
      Please see the agplv3.txt file accompanying this file.
      
   2. Commercial license allows you to develop and distribute your own software, 
      which includes OpenSubsystems software without the restriction presented 
      by the strict AGPL requirements. If you are distributing your application 
      in any way and you do not wish to release its source code to recipients of
      your application upon their request you should obtain from OpenSubsystems 
      the commercial license. By obtaining the commercial license you are not
      obligated to release any source code of your application as well as you 
      are not obligated to release any modifications to OpenSubsystems software 
      unless you wish to do so. Typical examples of commercial distributions 
      that require commercial license are:
          * Selling software to customers, which includes OpenSubsystems 
            software or requires OpenSubsystems software to be installed by 
            customer.
          * Building and selling hardware, which includes OpenSubsystems 
            software to customers.

Simply rule to follow: if you are developing and/or distributing application to 
which source code is not available and is not licensed under applicable open 
source license that is based on or includes OpenSubsystems software, you are 
required to obtain commercial license. To obtain commercial license contact us
